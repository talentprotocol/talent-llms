## Brand Essence

Talent exists to give builders the recognition they deserve.

The brand should feel:
- Credible
- Modern
- Builder-first
- Data-driven
- Confident without hype

---

## Positioning

**Talent is the largest network of verified onchain builders.**

- Talent is not a job board.
- Talent is not a résumé platform.
- Talent is not social media.

Talent is a **reputation and ranking system** powered by verified data.

## Visual Identity

---

---

### Iconography & UI Elements

- Simple, geometric icons
- Functional over decorative
- Icons should support comprehension, not branding flair

Guidelines:

### Motion & Interaction
