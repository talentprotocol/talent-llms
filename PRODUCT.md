## Positioning

### Primary Claim
**Talent is the largest network of verified onchain builders.**

**Tagline:** "Bet on builders."

**Competition:** LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network.

### Competitive Comparison

- LinkedIn is a directory; Talent is a leaderboard.
- LinkedIn is self-reported; Talent is verified.
- LinkedIn shows work history; Talent measures reputation.

## Current Focus

Primary focus: build a new app to connect builders and ecosystems through reward campaigns.

### Acquisition

- Ecosystem-sponsored rewards attract builders
- Shareable campaigns and leaderboards drive referrals

### Retention

- Flawless UX
- Gamification: leaderboards, streaks, badges
- Habit loop not solely dependent on rewards

### Revenue

- B2B: Ecosystems work with us to reach and retain top builders with high-ROI campaigns
- B2C: Builders pay for Talent Plus subscriptions to access features like increased visibility, access to more rewards, or profile analytics.


## Experiments & Future Directions

### Traders
- Exploring mechanisms for betting on builders.
- This is a high-potential revenue stream, but first we need an app that builders use regularly.

### Professionals
- Explore the largest supply of verified builders in crypto with advanced search tools.
- "Find proven builders, not just polished résumés."
- This is complementary to the core builder–ecosystem loop.
