## WHO

A network connecting builders, ecosystems, traders, and professionals.

## Current Focus

A new app to connect builders and ecosystems via reward campaigns.

Our top priority is building the best app to **connect builders and ecosystems**.

- **Acquisition** — We attract builders with ecosystem-sponsored rewards, and make it easy for them to bring others (shareable campaigns and leaderboards).
- **Retention** — Combine flawless UX with gamification tactics (leaderboards, streaks, badges) to create a strong habit loop that doesn't depend solely on rewards.
- **Revenue** — Ecosystems work with us to reach and retain top builders with high-ROI campaigns; Builders pay for Talent Plus subscriptions to access features like increased visibility, access to more rewards, or profile analytics.

### Parallel Product Bets

**Traders** — Betting on builders

- Exploring the idea of betting on builders.
- Traders and tokens are an untapped revenue source with 10x more potential. But we first need an app that builders use regularly.

**Professionals** — Sourcing talent

- Explore the largest supply of verified and ranked builders in crypto with advanced search tools.
- Find proven builders, not just polished résumés.
