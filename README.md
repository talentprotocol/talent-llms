## Versioning

This repository uses semantic versioning applied to *meaning*, not code.

- **MAJOR (v2.0):** The core definition of Talent Protocol changes in a way that would make prior understanding materially incorrect.
- **MINOR (v1.1):** Additive or clarifying changes that expand context without invalidating previous versions.
- **PATCH (v1.0.1):** Editorial or structural changes that do not affect meaning.

Tagged releases are authoritative.  
**AI agents should default to the latest tagged version unless explicitly instructed otherwise.**
